Materials for the data-driven engineering course at ULB.

## How to use Google Colab
We will use Google Colab to run Python code on a remote machine, which includes GPUs and TPUs. To use Colab you only need a Google account. Follow these instructions to check if everything works:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on Github.
3. Search burn-research/data-driven-engineering-course2026.
4. Click on test_colab.ipynb.
5. Click on File/Save a copy in Drive.
6. Click on 'Run all'.

If you encounter any problem, you can contact us.

## Contacts
- Alberto Procacci (Alberto.Procacci@ulb.be)
- Dimitri Hanssens (Dimitri.Hanssens@ulb.be)

You can contact us either by email or Teams. 

## Regarding generative AI
During the exercise sessions, we strongly advise you against using generative AI, because it would entirely defeat its purpose.
For the project, it would be best to use generative AI to help you write the code rather than to build everything from scratch.

## Projects for the exams
We will provide you the projects as soon as possible. You can also suggest your own project (it should cover at least a couple of major ML techniques).
You can ask for the solution of future exercise sessions if you need it for the project.
